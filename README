Utilities for integrating GitLab into a development environment

gitlab-pivot
Allows users to interface repositories managed by gitlab as their own system
user, bypassing the GitLab authentication system using certificates.

gitlab-groupsync
Allows group membership in GitLab to be governed by membership of system groups.

Both tools assume that a user has the same username in GitLab and on the system.
